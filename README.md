# Selenium Webtables

Sometimes in the app I encounter data in a tabular format. I can perform various types of operations on the __WebTables__, a.k.a. HTML tables.

There are 2 WebTable types:
1) __Static WebTable__ displays the same data any time I open the table. 
2) __Dynamic WebTable__ displays different data at different times. The data keeps dynamically updating.

What is a WebTable? How does it work with my app? What are the different tags available for the Webtable? How to represent rows, columns, headers, data and other things in the table? Let's find out.

Go to https://testautomationpractice.blogspot.com/. Scroll down to work on the HTML table.
